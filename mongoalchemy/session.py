''' Session objects handles the actual queueing of database operations.
    The primary methods on a session are query, insert, and flush.
    
    The preferred way to use a session is the `with statement`::
        
        s = Session(some_db)
        with s:
            s.insert(some_obj)
            obj = s.query(SomeClass).one()
            ...
    
    The with statement ensures that end_request is called on the 
    connection which can have a significant performance impact in some 
    situations because it will allow other threads to make use of the 
    `socket` connecting to the database.
    
    The session also responsible for ordering operations and knowing when
    operations need to be flushed, although it does not currently do
    anything intelligent for ordering.
