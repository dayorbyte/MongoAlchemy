======================

**NOTE: Over the next few weeks (starting July 22) I'm going to be making significant internal changes for efficiency and flexibilty.  The interface should be basically the same when I'm done, but you may want to keep this in mind!**


See: http://mongoalchemy.org/

This project is almost entirely driven by what people need.  There are still 
quite a few things which MA can't do that the standard mongo driver can, but 
they are largely things which I don't need to do (in particular, I basically 
never do server-side code execution for performance reasons) and so I don't
have as good of a grasp of what the common use-cases are or how to best make 
them easier to deal with.  If MongoAlchemy doesn't do something you need it to,
**please file a bug/feature request**.  I'm very responsive and **will typically 
turn around a case within a day or two**.
